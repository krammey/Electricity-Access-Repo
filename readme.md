### Project Topic
The project aimed to visualize global electrification trends from 1990 to 2014. An interactive website was created that allows site visitors to:

1.	View and/or download a gif showing the world map shaded to depict percentage of population with electricity access, by country, over time.
2.	Select a year for a map of electricity access to be generated.
3.	Select a country to generate the following information:
	* Average electricity growth rate
	* Rural vs. urban electricity access


### Datasets
Data was scraped from the Global Tracking Framework website: http://gtf.esmap.org/countries.


### Tools
The following tools were used:
* RStudio was used to clean and process the data and compute electrification rate averages.
* Shiny was used to create the website/user interface.
* ImageMagick was used in Terminal to create the gif.
* GitHub was used as a form of version control.


### Deliverables
The end result is this publicly accessible tool for observing electrification trends. The project is meant to serve as a starting point for further data analysis and visualization.
