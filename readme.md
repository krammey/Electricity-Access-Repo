## Tabs

The following tabs use different methods to visualize percentages of world populations with access to electricity.

#### Global Access by Year 
Select a year for a map of electricity access to be generated.

#### Rural Versus Urban Access By Country
Select a country and year to generate percentages of rural, urban, and national populations with access to electricity.

#### Gifs
View/download a gif showing the world map shaded to depict percentage of population with electricity access, by country, from 1990 to 2014. Choose between 2 options:

1.	All Countries
2.	High Impact Countries - Countries in which less than 50% of the population have access to electricity.



## Datasets
Data was scraped from the Global Tracking Framework website: http://gtf.esmap.org/countries. Data are unavailable for the following regions:

- Antarctica
- Ascension Island
- Azores
- Bes Islands
- Bonaire

<!-- ### Tools
The following tools were used:
* RStudio was used to clean and process the data and compute electrification rate averages.
* Shiny was used to create the website/user interface.
* ImageMagick was used in Terminal to create the gif.
* GitHub was used as a form of version control.


### Deliverables
The end result is this publicly accessible tool for observing electrification trends.-->

## Future Work
The project is meant to serve as a starting point for further data analysis and visualization.
